## String functions

### Converting strings to numbers

The following functions gets a string (null-terminated character array) as its input, and converts the provided string representation of an integer into its corresponding int value:

* `atoi()` changes string into `int` type
* `atol()` changes string into `long` type
* `atof()` changes string into `double` type

These functions are part of the `<stdlib.h>` library and can be used to convert string representations of numbers into their corresponding numeric types.

To convert a single-character string `str[0]` (e.g., "1") into the corresponding integer value 1, you can use the following methods:
1. Using character arithmetic:
```C
char str[2] = "1"; // string of length 2
int num = str[0] - '0';
```
2. Using `atoi()` with a temporary string:
```C
char str[2] = "1"; // string of length 2
char temp[2]; // string of length 2
temp[0] = str[0];
temp[1] = '\0';
int num = atoi(temp);
```
Both methods will yield the same result. In C, characters are represented as ASCII values, and the digits '0' to '9' have consecutive ASCII values. Subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from a digit character will give you the corresponding integer value.
