# Conditional branching statements in C

## if\~else
```C
if{
    ...
}else if{
    ...
}else{
    ...
}
```

## ternary operator

The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, provides a way to write conditional expressions in a compact form. The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:
```c
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

## switch\~case\~break
```C
int num;
switch(num){
    case 1:
        ...
        break;
    case 2:
        ...
        break;
    default:
        ...
}
```

## continue

The `continue` statement is used within a loop to skip the remaining code within the loop's body for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. It is often used in conjunction with conditional statements to selectively skip certain iterations based on specific conditions.

```C
for(int i=1;i<20;i++){
    // Disregard multiples of 2 or 3
    if(i%2==0 || i%3==0)
        continue;
    printf("%d", i);
}
```
