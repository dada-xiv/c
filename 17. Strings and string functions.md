# Strings and string functions

## Recognizing a whitespace character
`isspace` is a standard library function defined in the `<ctype.h>` header. It is used to determine whether a given character is considered whitespace. It is commonly used for character classification and character-based operations.

The `isspace` function takes a character as its argument and returns a non-zero value if the character is a whitespace character, and returns zero otherwise.

Whitespace characters include:

* Space character `' '`
* Horizontal tab `'\t'`
* Newline `'\n'`
* Carriage return `'\r'`
* Vertical tab `'\v'`
* Form feed `;`

## Converting strings to numbers

The following functions gets a string (null-terminated character array) as its input, and converts the provided string representation of an integer into its corresponding int value:

* `atoi()` changes string into `int` type
* `atol()` changes string into `long` type
* `atof()` changes string into `double` type

These functions are part of the `<stdlib.h>` library and can be used to convert string representations of numbers into their corresponding numeric types.

## Converting `char` to `int`

To convert a single-character string `str[0]` (e.g., "1") into the corresponding integer value 1, you can use the following methods:
1. Using character arithmetic:
```C
char str[2] = "1"; // string of length 2
int num = str[0] - '0';
```
2. Using `atoi()` with a temporary string:
```C
char str[2] = "1"; // string of length 2
char temp[2]; // string of length 2
temp[0] = str[0];
temp[1] = '\0';
int num = atoi(temp);
```
Both methods will yield the same result. In C, characters are represented as ASCII values, and the digits '0' to '9' have consecutive ASCII values. Subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from a digit character will give you the corresponding integer value.

## Determining alphabetic or digit

The `<ctype.h>` header provides functions for character classification. It contains functions that allow us to determine properties of characters, such as whether they are alphanumeric or digits:

* `isalpha(int c)`: Checks if the character `c` is an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z).
* `isdigit(int c)`: Checks if the character `c` is a digit (0-9).
* `isalnum(int c)`: Checks if the character `c` is alphanumeric (either an alphabetic character or a digit).

These functions take an `int` argument that represents the character (or the integer value of the character). They return non-zero values (typically `1`) if the condition is true, and `0` otherwise. Note that these functions expect the character to be represented as an `int` because they can handle the extended ASCII character set.

## Conversion between upper and lower cases

The `<ctype.h>` header provides functions for case conversion:

* `islower(int c)`: Checks if the character `c` is a lowercase alphabetic character (a-z).
* `isupper(int c)`: Checks if the character `c` is an uppercase alphabetic character (A-Z).
* `tolower(int c)`: Converts the character `c` to lowercase if it is an uppercase alphabetic character.
* `toupper(int c)`: Converts the character `c` to uppercase if it is a lowercase alphabetic character.

These functions take an `int` argument that represents the character (or the integer value of the character). They return non-zero values (typically `1`) if the condition is true, and `0` otherwise. Note that these functions expect the character to be represented as an `int` because they can handle the extended ASCII character set.


## Function that returns the length of a string: `strlen()`

The `strlen()` function returns the length of the string passed as a parameter.
```c
#include <string.h>
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```

## Functions for copying strings: `strcpy()`, `strncpy()`

`strncpy()` and `strcpy()` are used for copying strings.

```c
#include <string.h>
int strcpy(const char *dest, const char *src);
int strncpy(const char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strcpy()` copies the characters from the source string (`src`) to the destination string (`dest`) until it reaches the null-terminator (`'\0'`) of the source string.

`strncpy` copies at most `n` characters from the source string (`src`) to the destination string (`dest`). If the source string's length is greater than or equal to `n`, `strncpy` copies exactly `n` characters and does not null-terminate the destination string if it reaches `n`. If the length of the source string is less than `n`, the destination string is null-padded up to `n` characters.

## Functions for concatenating strings: `strcat()`, `strncat()`

`strcat()` and `strncat()` are functions that used for concatenating strings. 

```C
#include <string.h>
char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);
char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```
`strcat()` concatenates (appends) the source string (`src`) to the destination string (`dest`), and `strncat()` concatenates at most `n` characters from the source string (`src`) to the destination string (`dest`).

Here is an example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str1[20] = "Hello, ";
    char str2[] = "world!";
    
    strncat(str1, str2, 3); // Append only the first 3 characters of str2
    
    printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", str1); // Output: Concatenated string: Hello, wor
    
    return 0;
}
```
The output will be:
```
Hello, wor
```

## Functions for comparing strings: `strcmp()`, `strncmp()`

`strcmp()` and `strncmp()` are used for comparing two strings.

```c
#include <string.h>
int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);
```

`strcmp()` returns `0` if two strings are equal. If `s1` is lexicographically greater than `s2`, it returns a positive value. If `s1` is lexicographically less than `s2`, it returns a negative value. On the other hand, `strncmp()` compares up to `n` characters, where `n` is the maximum number of characters to compare.


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str1[] = "apple";
    char str2[] = "appetizer";

    int result = strncmp(str1, str2, 4);

    if (result == 0) {
        printf("The first 4 characters are equal.\n");
    } else if (result < 0) {
        printf("The first 4 characters of str1 are less than str2.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The first 4 characters of str1 are greater than str2.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
