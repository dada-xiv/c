# Introduction to C

## History of C

C99 refers to the 1999 version of the C programming language standard which include `_Bool` and `long long int`. It is the formal specification that defines the syntax, semantics, and features of the C programming language. C99 had been around for a longer period and was supported by most modern C compilers. C11 refers to the 2011 version of the C programming language standard.

## main() function

The following is a fundamental structure of a C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
	printf("Hello world!");
	return 0;
}
```
The output will be:
```
Hello world!
```

In C, the standard and recommended way to define the main() function is to use the int return type, as `int main()`. This is specified by the C language standard (ISO/IEC 9899). Using `void main()` is not a standard-compliant way to define the main() function. While some older compilers or non-standard environments may accept `void main()`, it is not portable and may lead to potential issues. The int return type of main() allows we to communicate the exit status of the program to the operating system. By convention, returning 0 from main() indicates successful execution, while a non-zero value is often used to indicate an error or abnormal termination.

### Examples

* Add two numbers : [add.c](add.c) 

* Gets a second and returns a `[hour, min, sec]` format : [formatSec.c](formatSec.c)


## Standard keywords
Here is a list of standard keywords in the C programming language: 
```c
auto     double   int      struct
break    else     long     switch
case     enum     register typedef
char     extern   return   union
const    float    short    unsigned
continue for      signed   void
default  goto     sizeof   volatile
do       if       static   while
```
These keywords have predefined meanings in the C language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) in the program. They cover the majority of the language's syntax and functionality. 

There are a few keywords in C that start with an underscore (_). These keywords are typically used for specific purposes and are not part of the standard set of keywords. Here are some examples:
```c
_Static_assert  _Imaginary     _Thread_local
_Alignas       _Generic        _Noreturn
_Alignof       _Bool           _Pragma
_Atomic        _Complex        _Static_assert
```
