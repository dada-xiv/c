# Functions

We should declare and prototype functions before their actual implementation if we want to write them down before `main()`. However, if we define the function before `main()`, no separate declaration is needed.

### Examples
* Takes three integers and returns the largest and smallest : 
    * by using `if` only : [getMaxMin_if.c](getMaxMin_if.c)
    * by using `if` and `?(tenary)` : [getMaxMin_ternary.c](getMaxMin_ternary.c)

* Fibonacci sequence generator : [fibonacci.c](fibonacci.c)
