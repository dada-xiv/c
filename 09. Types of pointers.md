# Types of pointers

## Pointer to pointer

A pointer is used to store a variable's address. However, a pointer itself is also a variable that is allocated memory space. Thus, we can use the `&` operator to obtain the memory address of the pointer, and the returned address can be stored in another pointer, which is called *a pointer to a pointer* (or a pointer of a pointer). See the following example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr = &num;
    int **pptr = &ptr; // A pointer to a pointer

    printf("The value stored at the address pointed to by ptr is %d.\n", *ptr);

    printf("The value stored at the address pointed by ptr stored at the address pointed by pptr is %d.\n", **pptr);

    return 0;
}
```
The output:
```
The value stored at the address pointed to by ptr is 10.
The value stored at the address pointed by ptr stored at the address pointed by pptr is 10.
```

### Call-by-reference and pointer of pointer

Recall the following call-by-reference example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int* ptr1, int* ptr2) {
    int temp = *ptr1;
    *ptr1 = *ptr2;
    *ptr2 = temp;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
    swap(&num1, &num2);
    printf("%d %d", num1, num2);
    return 0;
}
```
The output:
```
20 10
```
Inside the `swap` function, the values at those memory locations are accessed and swapped using the indirection operator `*`. As a result, the values of `num1` and `num2` in the `main` function are swapped.

Now consider the scenario where we store the addresses of `num1` and `num2` into the pointers `p1` and `p2`, respectively, and we pass the *addresses of these two pointers* to a function, rather than passing the addresses of the variables:

```c
int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
int *p1 = &num1;
int *p2 = &num2;
swapPtr(&p1, &p2);
```

To handle this situation in the function, we need to declare two *pointers to pointers* to accept the addresses of the pointers:

```c
void swapPtr(int **ptr1, int **ptr2){
    // swapping the 'pointers' (not the values)
}
```

The entire code would look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swapPtr(int **ptr1, int **ptr2) {
    int *temp = *ptr1;
    *ptr1 = *ptr2;
    *ptr2 = temp;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
    int *pt1 = &num1;
    int *pt2 = &num2;

    printf("Values:  %d %d\n", num1, num2);
    printf("Pointers: %d %d\n", *pt1, *pt2);

    swapPtr(&pt1, &pt2);

    printf("Values:  %d %d\n", num1, num2);
    printf("Pointers: %d %d\n", *pt1, *pt2);

    return 0;
}
```
The output will be:

```
Values:  10 20
Pointers: 10 20
Values:  10 20
Pointers: 20 10
```

Note that the `swapPtr()` function swaps the addresses of the given pointers, not the values of the variables pointed to by the pointers whose addresses were passed to the function.

### Pointer array and pointer type of pointer array

## Void pointer

There is no standard data type for the void pointer. This kind of pointer is usually created using the term `void`. One of the main uses of this pointer is to store or keep the address of some other variable.

## Null pointer

If we want to declare the pointer variable first and assign a valid address value later, it is better to initialize it in the following ways:
```C
int *ptr1 = 0;
int *ptr2 = NULL;
printf("Pointer value: %p\n", ptr1);
printf("Pointer value: %p\n", ptr2);
```
The output:
```
Pointer value: 0000000000000000
Pointer value: 0000000000000000
```

Here, the value `0` used to initialize the pointer variable `ptr1` is referred to as a 'null pointer'. This signifies that "`ptr1` points to nothing". Thus, the `*` operation does not impact anything in the memory space yet. The keyword `NULL` is equivalent to the constant
