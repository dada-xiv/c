# Types, Operators and Expressions

## 1. Standard keywords
Here is a list of standard keywords in the C programming language: 
```c
auto     double   int      struct
break    else     long     switch
case     enum     register typedef
char     extern   return   union
const    float    short    unsigned
continue for      signed   void
default  goto     sizeof   volatile
do       if       static   while
```
These keywords have predefined meanings in the C language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) in the program. They cover the majority of the language's syntax and functionality. 

There are a few keywords in C that start with an underscore (_). These keywords are typically used for specific purposes and are not part of the standard set of keywords. Here are some examples:
```c
_Static_assert  _Imaginary     _Thread_local
_Alignas       _Generic        _Noreturn
_Alignof       _Bool           _Pragma
_Atomic        _Complex        _Static_assert
```

## main() function

In C, the standard and recommended way to define the main() function is to use the int return type, as `int main()`. This is specified by the C language standard (ISO/IEC 9899). Using `void main()` is not a standard-compliant way to define the main() function. While some older compilers or non-standard environments may accept `void main()`, it is not portable and may lead to potential issues. The int return type of main() allows you to communicate the exit status of the program to the operating system. By convention, returning 0 from main() indicates successful execution, while a non-zero value is often used to indicate an error or abnormal termination.

### Examples
* [Hello World](hello.c) 
* [Add two numbers](add.c) 

## Version of C

C99 refers to the 1999 version of the C programming language standard. It is the formal specification that defines the syntax, semantics, and features of the C programming language. C99 had been around for a longer period and was supported by most modern C compilers. C11 refers to the 2011 version of the C programming language standard, which include `_Bool` and `long long int`.

## 2. Integers in Binary

In the C language, an integer is represented as a 4-byte value. However, here we explain it as a 1-byte vlaue for simplification, which corresponds to 8bits. If we want to store the integer +1 in a 1-byte memory space, we can do the following:
```
[0][0000001]
```
The leftmost [0] represents the sign and is referred to as the 'Most Significant Bit' or 'MSB'. The other 7 bits actually express the nummerical value.

When we want to express a negative integer, we should find the inverse element for the additive operation. In other words, for an integer value 'a', we should find the expression for '-a' such that 'a + (-a) = 0'. This process corresponds to finding the *complement* of 'a'. For example, to calculate the decimal number -6 in binary, we follow these steps:
* Step 1: +6 in decimal is 00000110 in binary; the left most significant bit (the first 0) is the sign.
* Step 2: interting all bits - changing every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0; flipping all bits in 00000110 gives 11111001.
* Step 3: add 1 to the entire inverted number, ignoring any overflow; adding the place value 1 to the flipped number 11111001 gives 11111010.
To veryfiy that 11111010 indeed has a value of -6, add the place values together, but subtracting the sign from the final calculation. That is,
```
   [00000110]
 + [11111010]
-------------
[1][00000000]
```
The left most [1] from the above should be subtracted and we indeed get [00000000], which is 0. Hence [1][1111010] is the right expression for -6 in 8-bit binary system where the left most [1] is the sign and [11111010] is the numerical value of the number -6. In fact,

$$
\begin{align*}
11111010 
= \, &  (1\times (-2)^7) + (1\times 2^6) + (1\times 2^5) + (1\times 2^4) \\
&+ (1\times 2^3) + (0\times 2^2) + (1\times 2^1) + (0\times 2^0) = -6\,.
\end{align*}
$$

* \>\> (Shift right)
* << (Shift left)

## 6. Types for strings

## 7. Variables and Constants

## 8. Type conversion

## 9. printf()

## 10. scanf()

The **scanf()** function reads input from the standard input stream `stdin`, according to format string. The format string consists of a sequence of directives which describe how to process the sequence of input characters. A typical directive is an ordinary character or a sequence of white-space characters. The format string contains the format specifications for reading the input. It can include format specifiers such as `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, `%c` for characters, `%s` for strings, and others.

If the end of input is reached before any matching and assignment occurs, scanf() returns the value `EOF`, which is typically defined as `-1` in C. The EOF value indicates the end-of-file condition, meaning that there is no more input to be read.

Here are some methods to get input until the end of the string:

```c
while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF);
while (scanf("%d", &n) != -1);
while (~scanf("%d", &n));
```
The first and second lines are equivalent since EOF represents -1. In the third line, the "~" operator negates the result of scanf, so that when -1 is received as EOF, 0 is returned, causing the while loop to exit.
