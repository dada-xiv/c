# Types, Operators and Expressions

## Standard keywords
Here is a list of standard keywords in the C programming language: 
```c
auto     double   int      struct
break    else     long     switch
case     enum     register typedef
char     extern   return   union
const    float    short    unsigned
continue for      signed   void
default  goto     sizeof   volatile
do       if       static   while
```
These keywords have predefined meanings in the C language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names) in the program. They cover the majority of the language's syntax and functionality. 

There are a few keywords in C that start with an underscore (_). These keywords are typically used for specific purposes and are not part of the standard set of keywords. Here are some examples:
```c
_Static_assert  _Imaginary     _Thread_local
_Alignas       _Generic        _Noreturn
_Alignof       _Bool           _Pragma
_Atomic        _Complex        _Static_assert
```

## main() function

In C, the standard and recommended way to define the main() function is to use the int return type, as `int main()`. This is specified by the C language standard (ISO/IEC 9899). Using `void main()` is not a standard-compliant way to define the main() function. While some older compilers or non-standard environments may accept `void main()`, it is not portable and may lead to potential issues. The int return type of main() allows we to communicate the exit status of the program to the operating system. By convention, returning 0 from main() indicates successful execution, while a non-zero value is often used to indicate an error or abnormal termination.

### Examples

* [hello.c](hello.c) 

* Add two numbers : [add.c](add.c) 

* Gets a second and returns a `[hour, min, sec]` format : [formatSec.c](formatSec.c)


## Version of C

C99 refers to the 1999 version of the C programming language standard which include `_Bool` and `long long int`. It is the formal specification that defines the syntax, semantics, and features of the C programming language. C99 had been around for a longer period and was supported by most modern C compilers. C11 refers to the 2011 version of the C programming language standard.

## Types for integers
There are several integer types with different ranges and sizes. Here are the commonly used integer types:

1. `char`: This is an 1-byte(8-bits) signed integer type. Since $2^{8} = 256$, `char` can represent character values or small integers in the range $-128$ to $127$, or $0$ to $255$ when unsigned by using `unsigned char`.

2. `int`: This is a 4-bytes(32-bits) signed integer. Since $2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$, `int` can represent integer values with a range of $-2^{31} = -2,147,483,648$ to $2^{31}-1 = 2,147,483,647 \simeq 2.15 \times 10^{9}$, or $0$ to $4,294,967,295$ when we use `unsigned int`. The maximum possible factorial number in `int` is $12! = 479,001,600$, and $13! = 6,227,020,800$ is larger than $2^{31}-1$.

3. `long long int` or `long long`: This is an 8-bytes(64-bits) signed integer type. Since $2^{64} = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616$, `long long int` provides a range from $-2^{63} = -9,223,372,036,854,775,808$ to $2^{63}-1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 \simeq 9.22 \times 10^{18}$, or $0$ to $18.45 \times 10^{18}$ when we use `unsigned long long int`. The maximum possible factorial number in `long long int` is $20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000$, and $21! = 51,090,942,171,709,440,000$ is larger than $2^{63}-1$.

4. `size_t`: This is an unsigned integer type used for representing the sizes of objects in memory. It is commonly used for array indices, loop counters, and memory allocations.

Although `int` occupies less memory than `long long int` and has faster operation speed, the `long long int` must be used when storing numbers that exceed the range that `int` can represent. For example, when dealing with problems that involve large numbers, such as finding the 80th Fibonacci number, the `long long int` is necessary to accommodate the larger values and prevent overflow or loss of precision.

The sizes and ranges of these integer types can vary depending on the system and compiler. To obtain the specific sizes and ranges on your system, you can use the `<limits.h>` header file and print the appropriate constants such as `CHAR_BIT`, `INT_MAX`, `INT_MIN`, `LONG_MAX`, `LONG_MIN`, etc.

> Here are some specific examples of games that were released before the introduction of C99 but that would have been impossible to create without long long int:
> * Doom (1993): This game was limited to a maximum of 32 enemies on-screen at once because of the limitations of the int data type. With long long int, this limit could have been increased, allowing for larger and more challenging battles.
> * Quake (1996): This game was limited to a maximum of 8,192 vertices in a 3D model because of the limitations of the int data type. With long long int, this limit could have been increased, allowing for more detailed models.
> * The Sims (2000): This game was limited to a maximum of 4,096 city tiles because of the limitations of the int data type. With long long int, this limit could have been increased, allowing for larger and more realistic cities.

## Integers in binary

In the C language, the most commonly used integer type is `int`, which is a 4-byte (32-bit) integer type. For simplicity, we will use the memory space of a `char`, which is a 1-byte (8-bit) *signed* integer type. With 8 bits, Since $2^8 = 256$, `char` can represent 256 integers in the range from -128 to 127.

Let's consider storing the integer +1 in this 1-byte memory space. It can be represented as follows:
```
[0][0000001]
```
Here, the leftmost bit [0] represents the sign and is called the 'Most Significant Bit' or 'MSB'. The remaining 7 bits actually express the numerical value. (Note that $2^7 = 128$.)

To indicate the sign of each number, we use the notation for *complement*. In other words, for an integer value `n`, we find the expression for `-n` such that `n + (-n) = 0`. This process corresponds to finding the complement of `n`. For example, to calculate the decimal number $-6$ in binary, we follow these steps:
* Step 1: $+6$ in decimal is 00000110 in binary; the left most significant bit (the first 0) is the sign.
* Step 2: interting all bits - changing every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0; flipping all bits in 00000110 gives 11111001.
* Step 3: add 1 to the entire inverted number, ignoring any overflow; adding the place value 1 to the flipped number 11111001 gives 11111010.
To veryfiy that 11111010 indeed has a value of $-6$, add the place values together, but subtracting the sign from the final calculation. That is,
```
   [00000110]
 + [11111010]
-------------
[1][00000000]
```
The left most [1] from the above should be subtracted and we indeed get [00000000], which is 0. Hence [1][1111010] is the right expression for $-6$ in 8-bit binary system where the left most [1] is the sign and [11111010] is the numerical value of the number $-6$. In fact,

$$
\begin{align*}
11111010 
= \, &  (1\times (-2)^7) + (1\times 2^6) + (1\times 2^5) + (1\times 2^4) \\
&+ (1\times 2^3) + (0\times 2^2) + (1\times 2^1) + (0\times 2^0) = -6\,.
\end{align*}
$$

By using this complement notation, we can represent integers in the range from [1][0000000] = $-128$ to [0][1111111] = $127$.

In particular, if we execute the following code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int n = 2147483647;
    printf("%d", n+1);
    return 0;
}
```
Then we would get the output:
```
-2147483648
```


## Types for floats

There are different types to represent decimal values with varying precision and range. Here are some commonly used types for decimals in C:

1. `float`: This is a 4-byte (= 32-bit) single-precision floating-point type that can represent decimal numbers with approximately 6 decimal digits of precision.
2. `double`: This is a 8-byte (= 64 bit) double-precision floating-point type that provides higher precision compared to `float`. It can represent decimal numbers with around 15 decimal digits of precision.
3. `long double`: This is an extended-precision floating-point type that offers even higher precision than `double`. The precision of `long double` varies across different systems but is generally greater than that of `double`.

> Fixed-point types: C also provides fixed-point types such as `short int`, `int`, `long int`, and `long long int`. These types can be used to represent decimal values with a fixed number of decimal places. The precision of fixed-point types depends on the range and size of the specific type.

In C, a `float` typically provides around 6 decimal digits of precision, while a `double` type offers approximately 15 decimal digits of precision. This means that a `float` is accurate up to a relative error of about $10^{-6}$, while a `double` is accurate up to a relative error of approximately $10^{-15}$. When we say that a `double` is safe up to a relative error of $10^{-15}$, it means that if the original value is $N$, the `double` representation will fall within the range of $N - 10^{-15}$ to $N + 10^{-15}$. In other words, while it is impossible to completely eliminate representation errors, we can quantify the magnitude of those errors. 

Considering the substantial difference between `float` and `double` in terms of precision, it is generally recommended to use `double` when high precision is required, as it provides significantly greater accuracy compared to `float`.

When comparing `doubles`, it's not recommended to use the equality operator (`==`) due to potential precision issues. Instead, it's better to compare the absolute difference between the numbers to a small threshold, such as `1e-12`, as shown in the following code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main(void) {
    double a = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1;
    double b = 0.3;
    if (fabs(a - b) < 1e-12) {
        printf("They are the same.");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Here the `fabs()` function from the `math.h` library is used to calculate the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

Moreover, when storing a `long long int` in a `double`, there can be a loss of precision or errors due to the limited number of significant digits in a `double`. The range of representable integers in a `double` is limited compared to the range of `long long int`, which can result in loss of precision or rounding errors. On the other hand, storing an `int` in a `double` doesn't typically result in errors or loss of precision because the range of representable integers in a `double` can accommodate the range of `int` values without loss of precision.


## Floats in binary : floating-point error

For example, 0.1875 can be transformed in binary as:
$$
\begin{align*}
3.1875 \div 2 &= 1 + 1.1875& \rightarrow 1 \\
1.1875 \div 2 &= 1 + 0.1875& \rightarrow 1 \\
0.1875 \times 2 &= 0.375 & \rightarrow 0 \\
0.375 \times 2 &= 0.75 & \rightarrow 0 \\
0.75 \times 2 &= 1.5 & \rightarrow 1 \\
0.5 \times 2 &= 1.0 & \rightarrow 1 
\end{align*}
$$
so that 
$$ 3.1875 = 1\times 2^{1} + 1\times 2^{0} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{0}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{2^4} = 11.0011_{(2)}\,.$$
On the other hand, since 
$$
\begin{align*}
0.1 \times 2 &= 0.2 & \rightarrow 0 \\
0.2 \times 2 &= 0.4 & \rightarrow 0 \\
0.4 \times 2 &= 0.8 & \rightarrow 0 \\
0.8 \times 2 &= 1.6 & \rightarrow 1 \\ 
0.6 \times 2 &= 1.2 & \rightarrow 1 \\ 
0.2 \times 2 &= 0.4 & \rightarrow 0 \\
 \cdots  & &
\end{align*}
$$
we have 
$$0.1 = 00011001100110011\cdots\,{}_{(2)}\,,$$
that is, $0.1$ is an infinite decimal so that it cannot be represented exactly in binary.

## Scientific notation in C

Floats can be expressed in scientific notation, such as $11101.001(2) = 1.1101001(2) \times 2^4$.

When representing a `float` numbers in binary, the fields are divided into the `sign`, `exponent`, and `fraction` fields. The `sign` field stores whether the number is negative or positive, the `exponent` field stores the exponent in scientific notation, and the `fraction` field stores the significant digits.

For a `float` type, the size of each field is 1-bit for the `sign` field, 8-bits for the `exponent` field, and 23-bits for the `fraction` field. For a `double` type, the sizes are 1-bit for the `sign` field, 11-bits for the `exponent` field, and 52-bits for the `fraction` field.

For example, $-6.75$ can be represented as $-1.1011(2) \times 2^2$. The `sign` field is 1, indicating a negative number. The `exponent` field is 2.

Note that in the `float` type, the exponent field has a width of 8 bits. To represent both positive and negative exponents, a *bias* is added to the actual exponent value before storing it in the exponent field. For the `float` type, the bias is 127. When converting the actual exponent value to binary, it is adjusted by adding the bias. Let's take the example of 129. To store 129 in the exponent field of a `float`, we add the bias of 127 to it, resulting in 256. The binary representation of 256 is 100000000. However, since the exponent field has a width of 8 bits, only the first 8 bits are stored. So, the exponent field will store 10000000. The purpose of adding the bias is to allow both positive and negative exponents to be properly represented. By adding the bias, the exponent field can accommodate a range of values that include negative exponents. Similarly, in the case of the `double` type, the exponent field has a width of 11 bits, and the bias is 1023.

In the fraction field, the significant digits of the number are stored after adjusting the value to be in the range of [1, 2). Let's consider the example of the current value being 1.1011. The first digit before the decimal point, which is *always* 1, is not stored in the fraction field. The remaining significant digits after the decimal point, which are 1011, are written in the fraction field. In binary representation, the fraction field is filled from the left. So, the significant digits 1011 would be stored as 1011000...00, with zeroes filled to the right. The number of zeroes depends on the width of the fraction field. By storing the significant digits in the fraction field, the precision of the number is preserved, allowing for accurate representation of the fractional part of the float number in binary format.

To display a float in scientific notation using printf(), we can use the `%E` format specifier.

> This method of storing floats is known as the IEEE-754 format.





## sizeof()

We can get the size of any type using the `sizeof` operator:
```C
int num = 10;
printf("%d", sizeof(num));
printf("%d", sizeof(int));
```
then the output will be
```
4
4
```

Note that the `pow()` function from `<math.h>` returns a `double` value, not an `integer`. For example, 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(){
    printf("%f\n", pow(2, 2));    
    printf("%d\n", (int)pow(2, 2));    
    return 0;
}
```
The output will be:
```
4.000000
4
```

## Types for strings

To obtain the ASCII code of a specific character, we can simply print it as an integer:
```C
char ch = 'A';
printf("ASCII code of '%c' is %d.\n", ch, ch);
```
To print a specific ASCII code as a character in C, we can simply use the `%c` format specifier in `printf`:
```C
int asciiCode = 65;
printf("Character corresponding to ASCII code %d is %c.\n", asciiCode, asciiCode);
```

## printf()

The percent symbol (%) is used as a format specifier. Hence if we want to print the percent symbol itself using `printf`, we need to use two consecutive percent symbols (%%) to escape the format specifier and indicate that we want to print a single percent symbol:
```c
  printf("The discount is 15%% off.");
```
which prints the output
```
The discount is 20% off.
```

## scanf()

The **scanf()** function reads input from the standard input stream `stdin`, according to format specifier. The format specifier has the from `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, `%c` for characters, `%s` for strings, and others.

If the end of input is reached before any matching and assignment occurs, scanf() returns the value `EOF`, which is typically defined as `-1` in C. The EOF value indicates the end-of-file condition, meaning that there is no more input to be read.

Here are some methods to get input until the end of the string:

```c
while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF);
while (scanf("%d", &n) != -1);
while (~scanf("%d", &n));
```
The first and second lines are equivalent since EOF represents -1. In the third line, the "~" operator negates the result of scanf, so that when -1 is received as EOF, 0 is returned, causing the while loop to exit.

### Including whitespace with `scanf()`

By using the format specifier `%[^\n]` in the `scanf` function, we can read a string that includes whitespace characters until a newline character (`\n`) is encountered:
```c
char str[50];
scanf("%[^\n]", str);
```
Here the `scanf` function will read characters from the input until a newline character is encountered, and store the scanned characters in the `str` array. The newline character is not included in the resulting string. (We should ensure the destination array `str` has enough space to accommodate the input string and a null-terminating character if necessary.)

The `scanf` function does not automatically detect the end of a line. By default, `scanf` reads input until it encounters whitespace characters, such as space, tab, or newline. However, it treats newline characters as whitespace and continues reading input until it finds a non-whitespace character.

To read input line by line until the end of file (EOF) using `scanf`, we can modify the format specifier by adding `%*c` at the end:
```c
char line[100];

// Read lines until the end of input (Ctrl+D on Unix/Linux, Ctrl+Z on Windows)
while (scanf("%[^\n]%*c", line) == 1) {
  // Process the current line
  printf("Line: %s\n", line);
}
```
In the code above, `%[^\n]` instructs `scanf` to match any character except a newline, and `%*c` is used to consume the newline character itself. This combination allows `scanf` to read input line by line correctly.

Note that although this approach works for many cases, using `fgets` is generally recommended for reading input line by line due to its better handling of line length, input buffering, and newline characters.
