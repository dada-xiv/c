# Arrays

We can define an array with a specified length as follows:
```C
int len = 20;
int arr[len];
```
We can initialize an array with specific values:
```C
int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
int arr2[5] = {1, 2};
``` 
For the second like, the remaining elements will be automatically set to 0 by default.

## Length of an array 

The length of an array can be determined by `sizeof(Array)`, which returns the byte length of the array:
```C
printf("sizeof(arr) = %d\n", sizeof(arr));
printf("length of arr[] = %d\n", sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int));
```
Then the code returns `20` and `4`, respectively.

### Examples
* Getting the array size : [arraySize.c](arraySize.c)

## Array and String

We can store a string in an array:
```C
char str[] = "Good morning!";
```
In this example, the string "Good morning!" is assigned to the array `str`. Note that the length of this array is `14`, not `13`, because the array includes a null character (`\0`) at the end.

The null character is used to indicate the termination of the string and is automatically added by the C compiler when initializing a string using double quotes. Therefore, the length of the array includes all the characters in the string plus the null character. `str[i] != '\0'` is equivalent to `str[i]! = 0`.

Therefore, from 
```C
char arr1[] = {'H', 'i', '!', '\0'};
char arr2[] = {'H', 'i', '!'};
```
`arr1` is a string because it is initialized with a null character (`\0`) explicitly included at the end. The null character marks the termination of the string, allowing it to be treated as a valid string in C. The string represented by `arr1` is equivalent to `char arr1[] = "Hi!"`. On the other hand, `arr2` is not a string. It is just an array of characters rather than a string. Without the null character, C does not recognize it as a valid string.

### Remarks
* The ASCII code value of the null character `\0` is 0, whereas the value of the white space character `' '` is 32.
* The `strlen()` function can be used to determine the length of a string excluding the null character ('\0'). It is part of the `<string.h>` library which will adress later.

## `scanf()` and Array

To assign a value to an element in an array, we can use the `scanf()` function. For example:
```C
char arr[50];
scanf("%c", &arr[1]);
```
In this snippet, the `%c` format specifier is used to read a single character from the user's input. The character is then assigned to the second element (`arr[1]`) in the array `arr`.

To read a whole string, we can use the following code:
```C
char str[50];
scanf("%s", str);
```
In this case, the `%s` format specifier is used to read a string from the user's input. The string is then stored in the array `str`.

Note that the `scanf` function with the `%s` format specifier reads a string until it encounters whitespace. It stops reading characters once it encounters a space, tab, or newline character. Furthermore, when we use `scanf` to read a string, the null character (`\0`) is automatically added at the end of the string, serving as the string terminator.

To read a whole line, including spaces, we can use the `fgets()` function instead, which we will adress later. It's also important to prevent buffer overflow by specifying the maximum length of the string when using `scanf()` to read strings.

### Examples
* Get a string and print its length : [readStringLength.c](readStringLength.c)
* Print the reverse of the input string : [reverseString.c](reverseString.c)

## Multidimensional arrays

We can initialize a multidimensional arrays when we define it:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[3][3] = {
        {1},
        {4, 5},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };

    printf("%d\n", arr[1][0]);
    printf("%d\n", arr[1][1]);
    printf("%d\n", arr[1][2]);

    return 0;
}
```
The output:
```
4
5
0
```
This is a 3x3 lower triangular matrix. The remaining elements, which correspond to the upper triangular part of the matrix, are automatically initialized to 0 by default. The above declaration is equivalent to the following:

```C
int arr[3][3] = {
    1, 0, 0,
    4, 5, 0,
    7, 8, 9
};
```

Moreover, when we declare a 2D array with initialization, we can omit its 'row size' because by initializing the compiler can count the total elements. So, if we write its column size, it can automatically infer the row size. Hence, the declaration is equivalent to:

```C
int arr[][3] = {
    {1, 0, 0},
    {4, 5, 0},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
