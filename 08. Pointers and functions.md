# Pointers and functions

## Passing arguments to functions

When we call a function, the value of the argument is *copied* as a local variable of the function. This means that the original variable and the function's local variable are completely separate from each other. Furthermore, we cannot pass an entire array to a function directly because arrays cannot be defined as function parameters. However, we can pass the address of the corresponding array instead. Moreover, we can modify the elements of the array by accessing them through their address in different functions. Let's consider the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void updateArray(int* arr, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] += 10;
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3};
    int size = sizeof(arr1) / sizeof(int);

    updateArray(arr1, size);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", *(arr1 + i));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The output will be:
```
11 12 13
```

In this example, we define the `updateArray` function, which takes an `int*` pointer and an integer `n` as arguments. By calling `updateArray(arr1, size)` in the `main` function and passing the address of `arr1`, we can modify the elements of `arr1` from within the function.

When declaring the `updateArray` function, we can also write the parameter as `int arr[]` instead of `int* arr`: 
```c
void updateArray(int arr[], int n){ ... }
```
However, if we want to use the size inside the called function, we should pass it as a separate argument. This is because when we only hand over the address of the array (`int* arr`), there is no direct way to determine the size of the array inside the function. Therefore, we cannot use `sizeof(arr)` inside the `updateArray` function to calculate the size of the passed array.


## Call-by-value and Call-by-reference

There are two ways to pass arguments to a function, **call-by-value** and **call-by-reference**. Many functions require the ability to modify variables in the caller or to pass a pointer to a large data object to avoid the overhead of passing the object by value, which may occur the overhead of making copies of objects. C provides a way to *simulate* call-by-reference by using pointers and the indirection operator `*`.

By using pointers, we can pass the addresses of the arguments to a function. This is achieved by applying the address operator (`&`) to the variable in the caller. When the address of a variable is passed to a function, the indirection operator (`*`) is used in the function to access and modify the value stored at that memory location in the caller's memory. Consider the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int* ptr1, int* ptr2) {
    int temp = *ptr1;
    *ptr1 = *ptr2;
    *ptr2 = temp;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
    swap(&num1, &num2);
    printf("%d %d", num1, num2);
    return 0;
}
```
The output:
```
20 10
```

Inside the `swap` function, the values at those memory locations are accessed and swapped using the indirection operator `*`. As a result, the values of `num1` and `num2` in the `main` function are swapped.

The `scanf` function is another example where we use call-by-reference. When we call `scanf` as `scanf("%d", &num)`, we pass the address of the `num` variable to the function. Inside `scanf`, the provided format string tells the function to expect an integer input, and `&num` is used to access and store the input value at the memory location of `num`.

Note that arrays are not passed using the `&` operator because in C, when an array is passed as an argument, the starting memory location of the array is automatically passed. For example, for an array `arrStr[]`, the name `arrStr` is equivalent to `&arrStr[0]`. Hence, we can simply use `arrStr` as an argument in functions like `scanf` without the need for the `&` operator.
